# Image Recognition AI

This project is an end-to-end image classification system built using Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and the CIFAR-10 dataset.
## Overview

The goal of this project was to create a functional image recognition system capable of classifying images into one of ten predefined categories. The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed with three convolution blocks, batch normalization, and a learning-rate schedule to improve accuracy and stability. After training for 40 epochs, the model achieved approximately **83.76% accuracy**, which is a strong result for CIFAR-10 without augmentation or transfer learning.

## Features

- **Trained CNN Model** using the CIFAR-10 dataset
